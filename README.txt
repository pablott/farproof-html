FARPROOF (C) 2012 Pablo Trabajos Tamayo
---------------------------------------

A browser-based software for displaying book-like 
presentations of books, magazines and brochures 
with a set of tools coverings the needs of pre-press
technicians and printshop customers.

FARPROOF delivers presentations similar to old-fashioned
paper based "proofs". It allows users to approve or reject pages
and add comments with corrections.

It is based on Django (the Python web framework) on the server side,
and mainly HTML5+CSS3+JScript on the client side.
